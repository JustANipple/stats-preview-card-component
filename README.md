## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Josh's Custom CSS Reset
- Custom properties
- Background images
- Media queries

### What I learned

I learned to reverse the flow of the elements in a flexbox

```css
    .container {
      flex-flow: column-reverse;
    }
```

### Continued development

It's not easy to work with images. Sometimes i prefer to use the element "img" and work with it, but sometimes, background-image works better. It's not clear to me how to use them yet, but i'm going to work on it

### Useful resources

- [Flex flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-flow) - This helps to understand how the flow in a flexbox works and how to reverse it
